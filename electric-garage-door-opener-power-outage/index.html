Its possible for your garage door to work without electricityyou must simply open it by hand. During a power outage you must manually open and close the garage door.

<p>Your garage door and its opener are designed to manage this tension safely but be sure not to do anything that feels risky or that seems outside of normal operation. If they arent however a few moments or hours of inconvenience arent worth damage to your door. A direct hit is not necessary for a lightning strike to damage household equipment. Because the garage door requires electricity in order to open and close with ease this is something that can be shut down due to an electric failure in the event of a storm or other common power outage cause.
