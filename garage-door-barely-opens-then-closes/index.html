You might need to consider replacing it if your door is not working properly or you may purchase a new opener. Im sure there is more than one cause of this problem but for me the issue was that the door was getting snagged slightly and once the chain pulls with too much tension it has an automatic failsafe and it stops pulling and lets the door down. I had to release the carriage and manually slide it open. Pin On Gardening.</p>
