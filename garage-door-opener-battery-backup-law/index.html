<p>In California a law was passed in September of 2018 requiring all newly purchased and installed garage door openers in residential applications have a battery back-up. Existing law requires an automatic garage door opener that is manufactured for sale purchased sold offered for sale or installed in a residence to comply with specified safety requirements including that the automatic garage door opener have an automatic reverse safety device. This caused serious amounts of damage and that included the destruction of power lines. The backup power supplies provided for garage door openers act a lot like any other rechargeable battery.
