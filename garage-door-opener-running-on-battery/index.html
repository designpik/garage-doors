<p>I have not had to reprogram the opener to make the remote work I just try a new battery and it works fine but not for long. Luckily changing the battery in the garage door opener keypad is not a difficult task. If it is a standby thing that may only operate the door a couple times a day and run a light for the short duration of using the car ot will be no issue and 100Ah is fine as long as it will support the minimum current in Ah manufacturer requirement of the inverter. Every battery holds enough juice to open and close the garage door twenty times or more. Chamberlain Cbln 3 4 Blt W Myq Mtr 207 In The Garage Door Openers Department At Lowes Com.</p>
